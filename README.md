# Guess the Number

Welcome to the "Guess the Number" project! This is a simple Java-based game where the computer generates a random number, and the player attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback on each guess and continues until the player guesses correctly.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: The computer selects a random number within a specified range.
- **User Input**: The player inputs guesses via the command line.
- **Feedback**: The game informs the player if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Replayability**: Players can restart the game after a successful guess or game over.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any text editor with command line access

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/guess-the-number.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd mini_project_java
   ```

3. **Compile the Code**:

   ```bash
   javac mini_project_java.java
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   java mini_project_java
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `mini_project_java` class.
2. **Make a Guess**: Enter your guess when prompted.
3. **Receive Feedback**: The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. **Guess Again**: Continue guessing until you find the correct number.
5. **Play Again**: Once you guess the number correctly, you can choose to play again or exit.

## Code Overview

- `mini_project_java.java`: Contains the main logic of the game, including random number generation, user input handling, and game flow control.

## Example

Here is an example of how the game might interact with a player:

```
Welcome to Guess the Number!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess:

50
Your guess is too high. Try again:

25
Your guess is too low. Try again:

37
Congratulations! You've guessed the number!
Would you like to play again? (yes/no)
```
